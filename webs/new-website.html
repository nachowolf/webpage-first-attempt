  <h2>Which city I would like to visit</h2>
  <h3>Krabi, Thailand</h3>

Beautiful sceneary, cool crystal blue water and
away from all the hustle and bustle of the fast
paced city life. Krabi is a place I would really
like to experience. Whereas most places
around Thailand offer great thrills for
both night and day, Krabi has a more relaxed
experience for visitors to just unwind.</p>

  <h2>Which Language I would like to learn</h2>
  <h3>Thai</h3>
  <p>I’ve been interested in learning Thai for quite some
time because it would make traveling around Thailand much easier if I could be able to
communicate with the locals.</p>

<h2>Historical places in Cape Town</h2>

<h3 align="center">The Castle Of Good Hope</h3>
<div class ="bottom">
<img src="assets/pictures/castle.jpg" alt="Castle of good hope">
</div>
<p>Built somewhere between 1666 and 1679 by the Dutch East India Company,
The Castle of Good Hope is the oldest existing colonial building in South Africa.
Originally the castle was constructed from clay and timber and named “Fort de
Goed Hoop” by Jan van Riebeck when he first settled in Cape Town. It was
mostly used as a refreshment stand for passing ships. It wasnt until after
tensions began to rise between the Dutch and the English did Jan van Riebeck’s
successor, Commander Zacharias Wagenaer, receive orders to build a pentagonal
fortress out of stone which today is known as the Castle of Good Hope. Personally I argue
that this so called “Castle” is actually a fort but that is just my opinion.</p>

<h3>The Iziko Museum</h3>
  <div class="bottom">

  </div>

<p>The Iziko Museum was originally a slave lodge built by the Dutch East India
company in 1679 and estimated to have housed up to 9000 slaves, convicts
and mentally ill between 1679 and 1811. In 1810 the building was modified to
house various governmental offices. In 1960 the building was restored and in
1966 the building opened its doors as the SA cultural museum up until 1998
where it was renamed the slave lodge. However, in 2000, the museum and all
its other associated sites combined together with its parent body to form the
Iziko museum. It’s a great site to visit to learn about the history of South Africa
but I’m more likely to be wandering around the marine exhibit pretending to be
a fish.</p>

<h3>City Hall, Cape Town</h3>
<div class="bottom">
<img src="assets/pictures/city-hall.jpg" alt="city hall">
</div>
<p>In 1900, the Mayor of Cape Town, Thomas Ball, laid the cornerstone of City Hall but it was only in
1905 that City Hall was opened. Designed in an italian Renaissance style by architects Reid and
Green, City Hall was one of the final victorian buildings to be erected in Cape Town. City Hall
overlooks the Grande Parade and has held many political gatherings. It was also here that Nelson
Mandela gave his first public speech hours after his release from prison on the 11 th of February
1990. I can only wish to have been able to experience such an amazing event but unfortunatly I
wasn’t born for another 7 years after the event.</p>
